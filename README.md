# UBB-Timetable

My Bachelor's degree thesis and project. Created a website using Java Spring and other libraries used for visualising my university's timetable. The application also supports scheduling a timetable based on a set of courses using various optimizations (e.g. group courses by proximity, otherwise insert a longer break).
